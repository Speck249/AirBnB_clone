# AirBnB Clone

## Project Description
The AirBnB Clone: Web-Static project introduces Front-End design to the HBnB Console. Using HTML and CSS, the
structuring and design implementation ensures that the (currently) static website features a search bar along
with displaying available places for rental with full information to aid the user's selection journey.

The files you'll encounter inside the current directory include HTML files(.html) and CSS(../styles/.css) files,
both ranging from a simple web page to the final product design as you progressivly move up the file indexes. Please
visit images/ to view images used throughout the website.
